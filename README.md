# Data-Stuctures
Basic Implementations of Data Structures
These are data structures using Java that I have implemented to teach myself data structures.
The LinkedList class represents a singly linked list of integers, and the node class represents a Node in a singly Linked List
encapuslating an integer and a reference to another Node.
The Stack class is implemented using an Array.
