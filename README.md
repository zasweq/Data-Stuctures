# Data-Stuctures

These are data structures that I implemented using Java to teach myself data structures.
The LinkedList class represents a singly linked list of integers, and the node class represents a Node in a singly Linked List
encapuslating an integer and a reference to another Node.
The Stack class is implemented using an Array.
